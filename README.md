# 🛍️ Amazon Clone

This is a simple front-end Amazon clone built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
I developed this project by following the **Apna College YouTube channel**, and added some extra styling and hover effects to enhance the UI.  
The layout is inspired by the Amazon India website and includes a header, hero section, shop categories, and footer.
